In the first part of question 1, the C code uses the `vfork()` system call to create a child process from a parent process. The program prints process IDs to show the execution order and parent-child relationships. After forking, the child prints its ID and its parent's ID before exiting. The parent waits for the child to complete and then prints the child's ID.
In summary, this code demonstrates how the vfork() system call can be used to create a child process. It illustrates the relationship between the parent and child processes by printing their respective PIDs and the order of execution.

In the second part of this question, the C code employs the `vfork()` system call to create a child process within a parent process. The program calculates the factorial of 4 in the child process and prints it. Meanwhile, in the parent process, it computes and prints the Fibonacci series up to 16, using both `factorial()` and `fibonacci()` functions. The parent process waits for the child to complete before displaying the Fibonacci series.
