In this question, the Bash script processes data from `input.txt` line by line. It creates a directory named "Result" if it doesn't exist already. For each line in `input.txt`, it extracts values for `x`, `y`, and `operation`. Depending on the operation ("xor," "product," or "compare"), the script performs the corresponding mathematical operation and stores the result in the `result` variable. Then, it appends a line to `Result/output.txt` indicating the calculated result for each line of input data. If an invalid operation is encountered, an error message is printed, and the script continues to the next line of input.
